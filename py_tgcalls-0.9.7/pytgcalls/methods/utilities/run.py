        This is a convenience method that calls start(), idle() and stop
        in sequence. It makes running a client less verbose, but is not
        suitable in case you want to run more than one client in a single
        main script, since idle() will block after starting the own client.

            PyTgCallsAlreadyRunning: In case you try
                to start an already started client.

    This function will run indefinitely in order to block the main
    script execution and prevent it from exiting while having client(s)
    that are still running in the background.

    The way PyTgCalls works, it will keep your handlers in a pool of
    worker threads, which are executed concurrently outside the main
    thread; calling idle() will ensure the client(s) will be kept alive
    by not letting the main script to end, until you decide to quit.

    Once a signal is received (e.g.: from CTRL+C) the function will
    terminate and your main script will continue.

        .. code-block:: python
            :emphasize-lines: 15
